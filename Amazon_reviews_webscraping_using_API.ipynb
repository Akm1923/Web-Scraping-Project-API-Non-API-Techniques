I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.\\n\\nThe phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.\\n\\nWhen we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.\\n\\nThe seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.\\n\\nLife got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.\\n\\nI went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).\\n\\nWhen I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!\\n\\nI also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!\\n\\nBetween the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!\", 'review_star_rating': '5', 'review_link': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IP3AW6JCCIH6', 'review_author_id': 'AGV4EJPKXIBH34HA77QD7KJF4SCQ', 'review_author': 'Chely', 'review_author_url': 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGV4EJPKXIBH34HA77QD7KJF4SCQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8', 'review_author_avatar': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png', 'review_images': [], 'review_video': None, 'review_date': 'Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024', 'is_verified_purchase': True, 'helpful_vote_statement': '92 people found this helpful', 'reviewed_product_asin': 'B07ZPKN6YR', 'is_vine': False}, {'review_id': 'R3VDU56XYE7XPV', 'review_title': 'It’s was good for the price', 'review_comment': 'I recently had the iPhone 11, from games to apps.

Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).\\n\\nAfter hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.\\n\\nA couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as \"excellent.\"  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.\\n\\nTo sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).

              "    'review_comment': \"I honestly can’t say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.\\n\\nThe phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.\\n\\nWhen we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.\\n\\nThe seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.\\n\\nLife got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.\\n\\nI went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).\\n\\nWhen I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!\\n\\nI also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!\\n\\nBetween the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!\",\n",

Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).\\n\\nAfter hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.\\n\\nA couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as \"excellent.\"  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.\\n\\nTo sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).  When my phone needs replacement, I would go with this seller again, but would not buy anything rated less than \"excellent condition\".',\n",

This seller shipped within 24 hours and it arrived within 48 hrs. I did my research and found the iPhone 11 is one of the most affordable and reliable 11 models so I took a chance and got  it over the iPhone XR because I really needed a phone that was higher than my iPhone 6 Plus that I had for 6 years.

              "  'review_comment': \"I honestly can’t say enough amazing things about my experience buying a renewed iPhone 11 from this seller and dealing with their customer service! I would 1000/10 recommend anyone and everyone even considering purchasing a phone from them to absolutely do so because you won’t be disappointed!!! But read below for the full story/review, both good and bad opinions.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter dropped her iPhone XR in the toilet and it completely died. This seller had the best priced renewed iPhone I found with next day delivery and good reviews, so I purchased the phone. It was my first time buying a phone that wasn’t brand new, so I was nervous about what condition the phone and battery would be in.\\n\\nThe phone was sent via UPS, which I didn’t love because they left the package at the gate on the street instead of driving into our ranch and delivering it to our house in the back corner like Amazon and USPS do. Not to mention it was supposed to be here between by like 1:45 or 2:45 and they didn’t deliver it until 10pm! But that’s an issue with UPS, not the seller.\\n\\nWhen we opened the package I was pleased to see that there were very minimal dents or scuff marks on the phone and it appeared to be in really good condition. One thing I wasn’t pleased with was the fact that the phone arrived dead. I worried that meant the battery wasn’t great, but I was wrong. After charging for a bit I checked the battery health and it was 100%, so they clearly installed a brand new battery! I was really happy with my purchase, but upon setting up the phone I noticed there was this awful high pitched screech/glitching sound coming from the speaker, so I reached out to the seller to try and get a replacement sent instead of going thru the hassle and delay of returning it and having to order a new one once the refund posted.\\n\\nThe seller responded almost immediately (they did so every single time we communicated over the course of a week, even when I reached out at almost 8pm their time!) and offered to send me the shipping label and then they’d overnight a replacement to me once they received the phone. I asked them if I could pay to overnight the phone to them so there wouldn’t be as long of a wait without a phone, and they said they would do me one better and as soon as I took the phone to the post office to send them a copy of my receipt and they’d overnight me the replacement then! This took place on a Friday and I didn’t want the shipping delay the weekend would cause, so I told them I’d reach out Monday for the shipping label and that I had out a brand new screen protector on the phone when I got it so I’d be sending it back with it on.\\n\\nLife got hectic and I didn’t reach out until Thursday afternoon, but they quickly sent me the shipping label. When trying to wipe the phone there was an hour delay because stolen phone protection was on, so I missed making it to the post office by like 6 mins and had to go Friday morning instead.\\n\\nI went to the post office and all was well until I mentioned that there was a phone in the package when I asked them for extra tape, and she said they couldn’t ship a used phone via priority mail (only new never used phones) so I needed to have them send me a hazardous shipping label instead. When I told the seller they offered to send me a new label, but I chose to try another post office first and just not mention the contents of the package because the battery WAS brand new, and I didn’t want to go thru the hassle of sending the label somewhere to be printed since I don’t have a printer, going there and paying to have it printed, and then going back to the post office. I took it to another post office nearby and had zero issues sending it.\\n\\nWhen I got back to the car I sent them a copy of the receipt, and true to their word within only like 5-10 minutes they had already send me the tracking information for the replacement shipment and let me know they put a screen protector on the new phone for me! Of course there were issues with UPS again including a delay that showed it wasn’t going to come until Monday, but thankfully it arrived on Saturday like it was supposed to, and fairly early (10-11am).\\n\\nWhen I opened the replacement package and inspected the phone I was SHOCKED! I thought the first phone was is great condition, but this one looked BRAND NEW! There wasn’t a single scratch or dent or scuff or any abnormality on the exterior of the phone! It’s also worth noting that the phone wasn't dead this time, it was midway charged. I checked the battery health again and it was also 100%! I tested out the speaker and there were no issues with the phone whatsoever. Honestly if you put it side by side with a brand new phone nobody could tell the difference, and it was a fraction of the cost of a new phone!\\n\\nI also reached out to the seller a few days later for a friend of mine to see if they also sold Androids and they were super helpful in getting me the info I was looking for!\\n\\nBetween the phenomenal condition of the phone and the excellent customer service, I won't buy a renewed phone from anyone else in the future when one of my daughters inevitably break their phone! This was honestly the best experience I've ever had with a seller/replacement item on Amazon in the 15+ years I've used the site!\",\n",

              "  'review_comment': 'I needed a new unlocked iPhone for my wife, since her 6 plus cannot run on any recent IOS iterations and is getting dropped by our mobile carrier.  Sooo, a used 11 seemed a logical choice, since her needs are minimal.  I have one as well and love it (no plans to upgrade).\\n\\nAfter hunting around for about a week, I finally committed.  The phone arrived early and properly packaged.  There were some scratches on the edges, but only one of note.  It even had a (perfect) screen protector.  It was unlocked, easy to set up, and seems to run flawlessly.  The battery reserve so far is okay, although iPhone Settings claim it is an aftermarket replacement, and cannot tell me anything about battery health.  Battery issues ae commonly reported with used phones, but mine seems fine.\\n\\nA couple of minor issues.  While the edge scratches were not functional, they were borderline for condition rated as \"excellent.\"  Also, when ordering, play the extra $5 for FedEx or UPS delivery.  Ours came USPS and arrived unexpected early.  It was left on the top of our mailbox, but I was able to get it before heading off for a short trip.\\n\\nTo sum up, this was a good phone at a decent price (about$225 with 128 GB memory).  When my phone needs replacement, I would go with this seller again, but would not buy anything rated less than \"excellent condition\".',\n",

This seller shipped within 24 hours and it arrived within 48 hrs. I did my research and found the iPhone 11 is one of the most affordable and reliable 11 models so I took a chance and got  it over the iPhone XR because I really needed a phone that was higher than my iPhone 6 Plus that I had for 6 years. It came brand new, no scratches. Thank you. You should definitely get it.',\n",
